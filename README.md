Interstellar Client
=============================

`interstellar-client` is a reference client for the new [Stellar network](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) and is part of the [Interstellar Module System](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar).

###Current state
This client is for developer exploration, not for use. It connects to Stellar's testnet. The testnet ledger will be reset when the system is ready for public release. We're designing the client mobile-first. It's currently accessible on desktop with a mobile layout.

> Quick start to developing in the Interstellar eco-system:
>
> * Read [`Getting started`](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar/tree/master/docs) doc.
> * Install [`interstellar-workspace`](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar-workspace).
> * [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to our [open-source modules](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar/blob/master/docs/module-list.md) or develop your own.

You may want to create a testnet account on the new Stellar network using [friendbot](http://www.stellar.org/galaxy#friendbot) if you need to login to the client.

## How it works
The Interstellar client is an application built with [Interstellar](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar). The command line tool takes several disparate modules based on customizable configuration to build the application:

Anybody can make their own web application by using Stellar.org's open-source modules or in conjunction with their own Interstellar modules.

## Guides

The [docs](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar/tree/master/docs) directory in [`interstellar`](https://github.com/stellar/interstellar) repo contains a set of development guides to help you work within the Interstellar Module System.
